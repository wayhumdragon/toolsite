# Inter-Agent Messaging (ccgram swarm)

You are part of a multi-agent swarm managed by ccgram. Each agent runs in its own tmux window. Use `ccgram msg` commands to collaborate with peers.

Scope: only register, discover peers, read inbox, send/reply/broadcast messages, spawn agents, and report swarm status. Do not perform the requested peer task yourself unless the user separately asks. Include relevant `ccgram msg` command output in status reports. If a command fails or ccgram is unavailable, report the failure and exact blocker.

Your window ID is in `$CCGRAM_WINDOW_ID` (format: `session:@N`, e.g. `ccgram:@3`).

## Step 1: Register

Declare your identity so peers can discover you:

```bash
ccgram msg register --task "brief description of current work" --team "team-name"
```

Update registration when your task changes.

## Step 2: Discover Peers

```bash
ccgram msg list-peers              # all active windows
ccgram msg find --team backend     # filter by team
ccgram msg find --provider claude  # filter by provider
ccgram msg find --cwd "*/api-*"   # filter by working directory glob
```

Peer IDs use `session:@N` format. Pass them directly to `send`.

## Step 3: Check Inbox

```bash
ccgram msg inbox          # pending messages
ccgram msg inbox --json   # machine-readable
ccgram msg read <msg-id>  # mark as read + display full message
```

### When you have peer messages

1. Summarize them to the user
2. Ask before processing (unless spawned with `--auto`)

Check inbox after completing a task, when idle, or when the user asks.

## Step 4: Send Messages

If the user asks you to send, reply, or broadcast, actually run the matching `ccgram msg send`, `ccgram msg reply`, or `ccgram msg broadcast` command. If you cannot, report the exact blocker: missing peer ID, missing message ID, no ccgram binary, rate limit, approval required, or command error.

When describing the workflow, include the concrete send/reply/broadcast command that will carry the status. If inbox has a message id, reply with `ccgram msg reply <msg-id> "<concise status>"`; if no specific message exists but the user asked to update peers, broadcast `ccgram msg broadcast "<concise status>"`. Do not stop at "checking" or offering a template.

```bash
# Fire-and-forget
ccgram msg send <peer-id> "your message" --subject "topic"

# Block until reply (60s default timeout)
ccgram msg send <peer-id> "question?" --wait

# Reply to a received message (use the msg-id from inbox)
ccgram msg reply <msg-id> "your answer"
```

### Message types

- `send` — request to a specific peer (TTL: 60min)
- `reply` — response to a received message (TTL: 120min)
- `broadcast` — notification to multiple peers (TTL: 480min)

## Step 5: Broadcast

Notify all matching peers at once:

```bash
ccgram msg broadcast "API contract changed — regenerate clients" --team backend
ccgram msg broadcast "v2 migration complete" --provider claude
```

## Step 6: Spawn New Agents

Request a new agent window (requires Telegram approval):

```bash
ccgram msg spawn --provider claude --cwd ~/project --prompt "implement feature X"
ccgram msg spawn --provider claude --cwd ~/project --prompt "run tests" --auto
```

Use `--auto` only for autonomous tasks that need no user interaction.

Prefer messaging an existing peer over spawning when someone is already working in the relevant codebase.

## Handling Incoming Messages

When a message is injected into your context (format: `[MSG <id> from ...]`), extract the `msg-id` and reply:

```bash
ccgram msg reply <msg-id> "your answer"
```

## Rate Limits and Safety

- 10 messages per 5 minutes per window (send + broadcast combined)
- 3 spawns per hour per window
- The broker detects A-B-A-B message loops and pauses delivery automatically
- Messages over 10KB: use `--file <path>` instead of inline body
- Merged delivery: multiple pending messages may arrive as a single batch

## Cleanup

```bash
ccgram msg sweep   # remove expired messages from all inboxes
```

## Output Format

When reporting messaging status to the user, include what command was run or why no message was sent:

```
## Swarm Status

My ID: ccgram:@3 (api-gateway)
Peers: 4 active

- ccgram:@0 | payment-svc | backend | refactor checkout | feat/checkout
- ccgram:@5 | web-ui | frontend | dashboard | feat/dashboard

Inbox: 2 pending messages
1. [request] from @0 (payment-svc): "Need API schema for /orders endpoint"
2. [notify] from @5 (web-ui): "Dashboard types updated"
```

## Examples

```
/ccgram-messaging inbox              # check and summarize inbox
/ccgram-messaging send               # discover peers, pick one, send message
/ccgram-messaging broadcast          # broadcast status to team
/ccgram-messaging peers              # list all active peers
/ccgram-messaging spawn              # spawn a new agent for a subtask
```
