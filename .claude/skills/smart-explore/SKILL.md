description: Token-efficient code navigation via AST parsing. Use when exploring file
  structure, cross-file symbol discovery, or targeted function extraction with smart_outline,
  smart_search, and smart_unfold. 10-20x fewer tokens than reading full files. NOT
  for semantic cross-file flow tracing (use searching-code/WarpGrep) or full-file
  content where AST structure is irrelevant.

# Smart Explore: AST-Based Code Navigation

Use these tools when available (requires claude-mem plugin). Fall back to Read/Grep/Glob if unavailable.

## When to Use Which

- **File structure at a glance** — `smart_outline` (~1,500 tokens)
- **Cross-file symbol discovery** — `smart_search` (~3,500 tokens)
- **Read a specific function/type** — `smart_unfold` (~400-2100 tokens)
- **Simple string search** — Grep (varies)
- **Full file needed** — Read (~8,000+ tokens)

## Progressive Disclosure Workflow

1. **Outline first**: `smart_outline` shows every function/class/interface with bodies collapsed
2. **Search if needed**: `smart_search` finds symbols across files by concept
3. **Unfold targeted**: `smart_unfold` extracts exact function source by AST node — never truncates
4. **Read only if needed**: Fall back to Read for files where AST parsing isn't useful

## Key Advantages

- **AST-based extraction** guarantees complete function bodies (no truncation)
- **Structural views** show all symbols without reading full file content
- **Predictable cost**: 1 tool call per operation, consistent token ranges
- **Composable**: outline → search → unfold chain naturally

## Failure Handling

- claude-mem plugin unavailable: fall back to Read for full files, Bash `rg`/`fd` for searches; note the token cost difference.
- `smart_outline` returns no symbols (binary or non-source file): skip to Read and report the file type.
- `smart_search` returns too many matches: narrow with a more specific term or add a path filter.
