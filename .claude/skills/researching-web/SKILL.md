# Web Research in Pi

Use Pi's Perplexity-backed tools:

- `web_search` for source discovery.
- `web_answer` for focused factual questions.
- `web_research` for broad or multi-step investigations.

## Boundaries

Use this for:

- comparisons and trade-offs
- recent facts and release behavior
- standards and external best practices
- vendor docs or public evidence

Do not use web tools for private code, secrets, credentials, proprietary data,
or local code exploration. Use local search first for repo-specific questions.

## Workflow

1. Restate the research question and decide if it is simple or broad.
2. For simple factual questions, use `web_answer` with a focused query.
3. For source selection, use `web_search`, then cite the best official or
   primary sources from the returned results.
4. For broad investigations, use `web_research` and tell the user the report
   will arrive asynchronously.
5. Compare claims against local project constraints before recommending changes.
6. Report uncertainty and source gaps directly.

## Failure Cases

- Web tools return no useful results: report the gap directly in the Gaps section; do not fabricate sources.
- Question requires private code or credentials to answer: refuse the web query, answer from local context only, and note the limitation.
- `web_research` is unavailable: fall back to `web_search` + `web_answer` and note the fallback.

## Output Contract

```markdown
## Research Result

### Answer

<concise answer>

### Evidence

- <source title/url or grounded result> — <why it matters>

### Fit For This Repo

<what changes because of local constraints>

### Gaps

<any missing evidence>
```
