description: Update project documentation based on code changes. Use when the user
  asks to update docs, document behavior, add README content, or align docs with recent
  implementation changes. NOT for extracting session learnings (use learning-patterns)
  or code-quality feedback (use reviewing-code).

# Documenting Code

Update docs from code facts, not vibes. Keep docs close to the behavior they
explain.

## Workflow

1. Identify changed files with `git diff --name-only` unless the user supplied
   paths.
2. Read the relevant implementation, tests, and existing docs.
3. Use `context7-cli` only when external API behavior or syntax is uncertain.
4. For large doc audits, launch one bounded `Agent` with `scout` to map changed
   behavior. Verify its claims before editing.
5. Update the smallest set of docs that users or maintainers need.
6. Run docs or repo validation.

## What To Update

- README usage or setup when user-visible behavior changes.
- API docs when parameters, output, or errors change.
- Architecture docs when module boundaries or data flow change.
- Generated catalogs only through their generator scripts.
- Plugin docs when skill, agent, hook, or command behavior changes.

## Rules

- Do not document dead or speculative behavior.
- Do not add promotional filler.
- Prefer examples that can be run.
- Keep private paths or secrets out of docs.
- If docs disagree with code, code wins unless the user says the docs are the
  intended contract.

## Verification

Run the narrowest relevant checks, for example:

```bash
markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md'
make validate
```

If a tool is missing, state that and run the next available check.
