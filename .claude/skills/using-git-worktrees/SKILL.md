# Git Worktrees

## Core Principle

Main repo stays on main/master — never edit directly. Every branch gets its own worktree (a sibling folder). Delete the worktree after the branch merges.

Think of a worktree as a **disposable branch folder**, not a long-lived parallel environment.

**Exception:** Trivial one-liner commits on a solo project can go directly on main to avoid ceremony overhead.

## Workflow

Check repo state before creating a worktree. Any worktree workflow description must name this dirty-state check before `git worktree add`:

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git worktree list
```

If the current worktree is dirty, ask whether to commit, stash, or create the new worktree anyway before proceeding. Confirm before running cleanup commands that remove worktrees or delete branches.

```bash
# 1. Create worktree for new work (from main repo)
git worktree add ../myproject-fix-cron -b fix-cron

# 2. Work there (open editor/Claude Code in that folder)
cd ../myproject-fix-cron

# 3. After PR is merged — confirm cleanup, then run from main repo
cd ../myproject
git worktree remove ../myproject-fix-cron
git branch -d fix-cron
git pull
```

## Directory Layout

Worktrees are **sibling directories** (not nested inside the repo):

```
~/projects/
├── myproject/                    # main worktree — always on main, always clean
├── myproject-fix-cron/           # worktree for fix-cron branch
└── myproject-add-model/          # worktree for add-model branch
```

**Why siblings:** no .gitignore pollution, clean git status, independent build artifacts.

## Naming Convention

`<project>-<branch-slug>` — slashes become dashes, self-documenting.

- **`fix-cron`** — `../myproject-fix-cron`
- **`feature/auth`** — `../myproject-feature-auth`
- **`bugfix/issue-123`** — `../myproject-bugfix-123`

## When to Suggest Worktrees

- User wants to start a new feature, fix, or experiment
- User is about to edit code on main/master
- User wants to try multiple approaches to the same problem
- User has uncommitted changes and wants to start something else

## Failure handling

- Worktree path already exists: pick a different sibling name; never force-overwrite.
- Branch already exists remotely: use `git worktree add ../name branch` (no `-b`) to check it out.
- Dirty main repo when user wants a new worktree: ask to commit, stash, or proceed anyway — do not silently stash.
- `git worktree remove` fails with "is dirty": confirm with user before running `git worktree remove --force`.
